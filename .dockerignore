# Exclude Frontend entirely (Vercel handles it)
frontend/
# (But wait, if we exclude frontend entirely, COPY . . won't copy it, which is good for backend build speed)
# BUT we need to be careful if backend serves any frontend assets? (No, backend is API).

# Exclude Local Backend Artifacts
backend/server
backend/server.exe
backend/vendor
backend/uploads
backend/tmp

# Exclude Git
.git

# Exclude Misc
.vscode
.idea
.DS_Store
*.md
